## Introduction

This project is a simple React-based accordion layout that allows users to click on a header to show or hide content. It is designed to help beginners understand the basics of **state management** in React using the `useState` hook. The accordion is a common UI pattern used in FAQs, menus, and more.

## Features

- **Toggle Content Visibility**: Click on an accordion header to show or hide its content.
- **Simple State Management**: Uses React's `useState` hook to manage the open/close state of each accordion item.
- **Reusable Components**: The accordion is built as a reusable React component.
- **Minimal Design**: Clean and simple UI for easy understanding.

## How to Use

1. **Click on a Header**:
   - Click on any accordion header to expand it and view the content.
   - Click again to collapse the content.

2. **Multiple Accordions**:
   - Each accordion item works independently, so you can expand or collapse them individually.
